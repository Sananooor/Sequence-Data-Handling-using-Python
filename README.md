ðŸ§¬ Sequence Data Handling Using Python:

Welcome to the Sequence Data Handling Using Python repository! This project provides a collection of Python scripts tailored for sequence analysis in bioinformatics. The notebook included here is designed to help beginners perform a variety of tasks, from counting sequences to identifying open reading frames (ORFs) detecting sequence repeats, and saving outputs in CSV files.

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python scripts designed for efficient sequence data handling and analysis in bioinformatics. The included Jupyter notebook provides practical examples of how to count sequences, parse FASTA files, detect sequence repeats, and identify open reading frames (ORFs). Whether you're working on genomic data analysis or exploring bioinformatics, this resource offers valuable tools to streamline your workflow.

ðŸŒŸ Features:

FASTA Sequence Counting: Quickly count the number of sequences in a given FASTA file.
Sequence Parsing and Analysis: Parse sequences from FASTA files, analyze their lengths and identify the longest and shortest sequences.
Repeat Detection: Detect and count repeats of a specified length within sequences.
Open Reading Frame (ORF) Identification: Identify the longest ORF within a sequence, crucial for gene prediction.
